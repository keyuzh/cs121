# Search and Retrieve
# • Once you have built the inverted index, you are ready to test document retrieval with
# queries.
# • At the very least, the documents retrieved should be returned based on tf-idf scoring. This
# can be done using
# • the cosine similarity method. Feel free to use a library to compute cosine similarity once you
# have the term frequencies and inverse document frequencies.
# • You may add other weighting/scoring mechanisms to help refine the search results
