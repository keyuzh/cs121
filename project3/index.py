# construct inverted index with key=token, value=where the token occur; TF-IDF, etc

# Building the inverted index
# • Now that you have been provided the HTML files to index. You may build your inverted
# index off of them.
# • As most of you may already know, the inverted index is simply a map with the token as a key
# and a list of its corresponding postings.
# • A posting is nothing but the representation of the token’s occurrence in a document.
# • The posting would typically (not limited to) contain the following info (you are encouraged
# to think of other attributes that you could add to the index) :
# • The document name/id the token was found in.
# • The word frequency.
# • Indices of occurrence within the document
# • Tf-idf score etc
